# Property-based testing with clojure.spec

Clojure.spec was [released recently in may 2016](http://clojure.org/news/2016/05/23/introducing-clojure-spec) and it was a perfect occasion to have [Romeu](https://twitter.com/malk_zameth) speaking about Property-based Testing using clojure.spec.

The live coding session use the Bowling kata as a material, for those who wonder what that kata is here is a brief reminder:

## Bowling Game Domain and Rules

![Game](img/game.png)

The game consists of **10 frames** as shown above. In each frame the player has two opportunities to knock down 10 pins. The score for the frame is the total number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for strikes and spares.

A **spare** is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two tries. The **bonus** for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll. ‘/’ denote a spare in the score sheet.
A **strike** is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first try. The **bonus** for that frame is the value of the next two balls rolled. ‘X’ denote a striker in the score sheet.

In the **tenth frame** a player who rolls a spare or strike is allowed to roll the **extra balls** to complete the frame (so 3 balls can be rolled in tenth frame).

## Video of the meetup session

## Traditional Solutions to the Kata

There is [my own solution](https://github.com/jgrodziski/clojure-bowling-game/blob/master/src/bowling/core.clj), the one from [FlyingTof](https://twitter.com/devatsky) in [this repo](https://github.com/flyingtof/clojing) and the one from [Jon](https://twitter.com/ahoy_jon) and [Thomas](https://twitter.com/dikalikatao): [thomas-and-john-solution](https://github.com/jgrodziski/clojure-bowling-game/blob/master/thomas-and-john-solutions/src/bowling-game/core.clj).

[Hiram](https://twitter.com/HiramMadelaine) made [a great graphical version of the Bowling Kata with devcards](https://github.com/hiram-madelaine/bowling-kata).
